    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) within a class. It involves hiding the internal details and providing a public interface to interact with the object. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, ensuring that the object's state can only be accessed and modified through defined methods, promoting data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). The derived classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of the base class, enabling code reuse and the establishment of an \"is-a\" relationship. Inheritance promotes hierarchical organization and supports the concept of specialization and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It provides a way to perform a single action in different ways based on the object type. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (having the same method name in different classes with different implementations) and method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). It promotes code flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to write more generic and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining the interface or contract for a class, without providing the implementation details. Abstraction allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, which serve as blueprints for concrete classes. It helps in managing complexity, reducing dependencies, and promoting modular design."
